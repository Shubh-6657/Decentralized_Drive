# Decentralized Drive

Welcome to Decentralized Drive! This project provides a decentralized solution for managing and storing your files. Built using React and utilizing Create React App, this application offers an easy way to interact with a decentralized file storage system.

# Getting Started
To get started with Decentralized Drive, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

`npm start`: Launches the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

`npm test`: Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is useful for running and monitoring tests during development.

`npm run build`: Builds the application for production. The optimized and minified production build will be available in the build folder. This is what you would use when deploying the application.

`npm run eject`: Note: This is a one-way operation. Ejecting provides you full control over configuration and dependencies, allowing advanced customization. However, this action is irreversible.
